> This project is currently in **Alpha** state. You can try it out at your own risk, but be aware that things might break and **DATA LOSS** may occur.

Endurain is a self-hosted fitness tracking service that operates much like Strava but allows users to have complete control over their data and the hosting environment. The application's frontend is built using a combination of PHP, HTML, basic JavaScript, and Bootstrap CSS. On the backend, it leverages Python FastAPI, Alembic, SQLAlchemy, stravalib and gpxpy for seamless integration with Strava and .gpx file import. The MariaDB database engine is employed to efficiently store and manage user data, while Jaeger is used for basic observability.

To deploy Endurain, Docker images are available, and a comprehensive example can be found in the "docker-compose.yml" file provided. Configuration is facilitated through environment variables, ensuring flexibility and ease of customization.

As a non-professional developer, my journey with Endurain involved learning and implementing new technologies and concepts, with invaluable assistance from ChatGPT. The primary motivation behind this project was to gain hands-on experience and expand my understanding of modern development practices. Second motivation is that I'm an amateur triathlete and I want to keep track of my gear and gear components usage.

If you have any recommendations or insights on improving any aspect of Endurain, whether related to technology choices, user experience, or any other relevant area, I would greatly appreciate your input. The goal is to create a reliable and user-friendly fitness tracking solution that caters to the needs of individuals who prefer self-hosted applications. Your constructive feedback will undoubtedly contribute to the refinement of Endurain.

 - User: admin
